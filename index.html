<h1>Berkshire Hathaway</h1>
<p>From Failing Textile Mill to Apple’s Largest Shareholder</p>
</header>

<section>
<h2>1. The Textile Origins (1880s–1965)</h2>

<figure>
<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3d/Berkshire_Cotton_Manufacturing_Company%2C_Adams%2C_MA.jpg">
<figcaption>
<strong>Berkshire Cotton Manufacturing Company (1898, Adams, MA).</strong>
This textile operation was one of the predecessors of Berkshire Hathaway. 
The company eventually merged with Hathaway Manufacturing in 1955 to form Berkshire Hathaway.
</figcaption>
</figure>

<figure>
<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7c/Hine_-_Spinners_in_cotton_mill.jpg">
<figcaption>
<strong>Inside a Berkshire cotton mill (1912).</strong>
The textile industry required heavy capital investment but produced poor long-term returns. 
This experience deeply shaped Warren Buffett’s later philosophy: avoid capital-intensive, low-return businesses.
</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
By the early 1960s, Berkshire Hathaway was a struggling textile company. 
Warren Buffett began buying shares in 1962, initially viewing it as a classic “cigar butt” investment — a cheap company with a few remaining profitable puffs.
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>2. Warren Buffett Takes Control (1965)</h2>

<figure>
<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/51/Warren_Buffett_2015.jpg">
<figcaption>
<strong>Warren Buffett (2015).</strong>
Buffett gained control of Berkshire Hathaway in 1965. 
What began as a textile turnaround attempt soon evolved into something radically different: 
a capital allocation vehicle.
</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
Buffett realized the textile business had no durable competitive advantage. 
Instead of reinvesting profits into more textile machinery, he redirected capital into insurance.
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>3. The Insurance Revolution (1967)</h2>

<figure>
<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5b/National_Indemnity_Company_building%2C_Omaha%2C_NE.jpg">
<figcaption>
<strong>National Indemnity Company (Omaha).</strong>
Purchased in 1967 for $8.6 million, National Indemnity transformed Berkshire.
It introduced Buffett to one of the most powerful financial tools in corporate history: insurance float.
</figcaption>
</figure>

<figure>
<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8b/GEICO_headquarters.jpg">
<figcaption>
<strong>GEICO Headquarters.</strong>
GEICO became wholly owned by Berkshire in 1996.
Its low-cost auto insurance model generated massive float at underwriting profits.
</figcaption>
</figure>

<div class="float-diagram">
<h3>How Insurance Float Works</h3>
<p>
1️⃣ Customers pay premiums upfront.<br>
2️⃣ Berkshire holds that money before claims are paid.<br>
3️⃣ That money (the float) is invested in stocks, bonds, and businesses.<br>
4️⃣ If underwriting is profitable, Berkshire gets paid to hold the float.
</p>
</div>

<p>
Float became the engine that powered Berkshire’s investment machine. 
Unlike debt, float often costs nothing — and sometimes generates profit.
</p>

<section>
<h2>4. Asset Allocation Mastery</h2>

<figure>
<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4e/Warren_Buffett_and_Charlie_Munger_1998.jpg">
<figcaption>
<strong>Buffett and Charlie Munger (1998).</strong>
Munger’s influence shifted Berkshire from buying cheap businesses to buying great businesses at fair prices.
This dramatically improved long-term returns.
</figcaption>
</figure>

<canvas id="allocationChart"></canvas>

<script>
const ctx = document.getElementById('allocationChart');
new Chart(ctx, {
    type: 'pie',
    data: {
        labels: ['Insurance Operations', 'Wholly Owned Businesses', 'Public Equities (Apple Largest)', 'Cash & Treasuries'],
        datasets: [{
            data: [25, 30, 35, 10],
        }]
    }
});
</script>

<p>
Berkshire’s asset allocation philosophy rests on:
- Permanent capital
- Conservative leverage
- Concentrated equity investments
- Reinvestment of float
</p>

<h2>5. The Apple Investment (2016–Present)</h2>

<figure>
<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Apple_Park_Cupertino_2019.jpg">
<figcaption>
<strong>Apple Park, Cupertino.</strong>
Berkshire began purchasing Apple shares in 2016. 
By 2018, Apple had become Berkshire’s largest equity holding.
</figcaption>
</figure>

<figure>
<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Apple_logo_black.svg">
<figcaption>
<strong>Apple Logo.</strong>
Buffett described Apple not as a tech stock, but as a consumer ecosystem with extraordinary brand loyalty.
</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
The Apple investment demonstrated Buffett’s evolution:
- Emphasis on ecosystem economics
- Massive share repurchases increasing ownership percentage
- Durable competitive advantage
- Recurring revenue streams

Apple eventually represented the largest single equity position in Berkshire’s portfolio — 
a remarkable transformation from a 19th‑century textile mill.
